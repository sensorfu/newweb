    <h1 class="my-4">Designed for customers who depend on network segmentation</h1>

    <p>
        The core security control, especially in OT environments, is network segmentation. It’s essential, 
        yet often uncertain. You may call it isolation, segregation, partition, sandboxing or air-gapping - 
        but do you know if it works?
    </p>
    <p>
        We’ve found out that over 80% of the organisations that have deployed Beacons into their live 
        production networks have found surprises in their network segmentation. Knowing the leaks is the 
        first step to fixing the leaks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firewall rules, routing, VPNs, switch VLANs, cabling - it is impossible to know that everything 
        is working  correctly everywhere, all the time! With SensorFu Beacon, the verification of your 
        most important security control is straightforward and continuous.
    </p>
    <h2>Continuous Validation, Minimal Friction</h2>
    <p>
        Beacons are intentionally lightweight. They run silently in the background, 
        trying to reach their Home, sending an escape test packet once every second. 
        The escape packets are attempts to communicate through isolation boundaries 
        using multiple methods over IPv4 and IPv6 networks. If a Beacon reaches Home, 
        the system alerts instantly, no delays, no overload.
    </p>
    <h2>Deploy Where It Matters</h2>
    <p>
        From energy substations and oil refineries to food and beverage production 
        and logistics automation, Beacon adapts to complex environments. Use it 
        across multiple sites or mission-critical network segments to continuously 
        verify that your segmentation policies are effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than finding 300 potential issues in one location, test one important 
        security control in 300 locations
    </p>
    <h2>Quick and easy deployment</h2>
    <p>
        Beacons can be deployed as Linux or Windows applications, Docker containers, 
        virtual machines, or dedicated devices. SensorFu Beacon integrates seamlessly 
        with most SIEM systems, IDS solutions and NDR providers.

            <p>
                The Beacon Application is easy to deploy in existing environments. You 
                can use management tools such as Microsoft System Center, Group Policy 
                Objects (GPO), Puppet, Ansible, and others. Simply integrate the Beacon 
                Application into your automation workflows to gain full visibility into 
                the effectiveness of your network isolation.

                Use Beacon Devices to test network isolation in on-premises environments. 
                Leave them behind, move them around—deploy them anywhere. Compatible with 
                Raspberry Pi*. Simply download the image from Beacon Home, copy it to an SD 
                card, and you’re ready to deploy the Beacon Device to your network.
