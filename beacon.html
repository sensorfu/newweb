      <p class="lead">
        We designed SensorFu Beacon for organizations that rely on network
        segmentation, especially in OT environments. Beacons continuously
        test your isolated networks to verify that segmentation is truly
        working. In over 80% of deployments, SensorFu Beacon has uncovered critical gaps
        that led to stronger, safer systems. Knowing where the leaks are is 
        the first step toward to fixing them.

      <h3>Continuous Validation,<br />Minimal Friction</h3>
      <p>
        Beacons are intentionally lightweight, running silently in the
        background performing two test cycles: the Fast Loop, which completes in
        30 minutes, and the Slow Loop, which spans 2-8 days. Their sole purpose is
        to 'reach home' by sending an escape test packet every second. These
        packets attempt to communicate across isolation boundaries using various
        methods over both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. If a Beacon reaches home, an
        alert is sent.

      <h3>Deploy Where<br />It Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than identifying 300 potential issues in one location, validate one
        critical security control across 300 locations. From energy substations and
        oil refineries to food and beverage production and logistics automation,
        SensorFu Beacon adapts to complex environments. Deploy it across multiple sites or
        mission-critical network segments to verify that segmentation policies
        remain effective and that existing controls keep high-value assets and
        critical systems isolated.

      />

      <h3>Quick and easy deployment</h3>
      <p>
        Beacons can be deployed as Linux or Windows applications, Docker
        containers, virtual machines, or dedicated devices, allowing you reuse
        your existing infrastructure. SensorFu Beacon integrates seamlessly with
        most SIEM systems, IDS solutions, and NDR providers. This makes rollout,
        monitoring, and long-term maintenance straightforward for security
        operations teams - even in large, distributed or highly regulated
        environments.

    <h2>Breaking Out of Isolation - The Great Escape</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Years of research into network protocols and escape techniques have been turned
      into a practical, automated test set. <br />
      Here's how it works:
    </p>

    <dl class="row mb-4">
      <dt class="col-sm-2 fw-semibold">The Basics:</dt>
      <dd class="col-sm-10">
