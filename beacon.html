    <p>
        We want our clients to be certain that their security policies and protection measures are, and stay, working as they should. Often, maintaining network security lacks validation, causing anxiety over possible hiccups and misconfigurations, which can lead to revenue losses. 
        You rely on it. You may call it isolation, segregation, segmentation, partition, or sandboxing. But do you know it works? Privacy, critical infrastructure protection, payment safety, or your sanity may require it. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Beacons can be deployed in bare metal, virtual machines, containers, and even on small gadgets. And it is
        compatible with your deployment solution.

        We got you covered.
