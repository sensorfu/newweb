            <h1>Fundamental cyber security for advanced protection</h1>
            <p>
                At SensorFu, we believe cybersecurity starts with the fundamentals. 
                In a world of complex threats and reactive tools, our mission is to make the basics visible, 
                verifiable, and trusted. We founded SensorFu to ensure network isolation isn't just assumed,
                but continuously assured. 
                
                Our vision stemmed from recurring gaps in network segmentation and the risks of unnoticed misconfigurations.
                Rather than adding complexity, we decided to simplify and solve the root problem securely and swiftly.
                
                SensorFu isn't just a product; it's an underlying principle, a commitment to securing infrastructure through
                'security by design', implemented from the ground up with core cybersecurity principles. We continuously innovate, 
                ensuring our solutions adapt to evolving threats. This means we provide proactive and continuous validation of isolated 
                networks, operating silently to offer a safer, permanent solution that preserves the integrity and assurance of our customers'
                cybersecurity policies without unnecessary complexity.

                    "We started SensorFu in order to go back to basics with
                    IT security. We feel that security requirements pile up,
                    while systems and security solutions get more complex by
                    the day. Our products give our customers assurance that
                    their security policies are and stay sealed."
