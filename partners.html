        Our mission is to help you get organized in cyber defense through
        defense cells. We want to get both governmental and commercial cyber
        security centers and other cyber officials connected with companies and
        organizations to share the critical threat intelligence between each
        other. The more threat intelligence is spread inside a defense cell the
        more resilient the parties and eventually, the internet, become.

      <h2>Sectra</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity solutions and services for a new era. In order to offer
        the best possible product to the public, critical infrastructure
        operations have several types of systems and networks that communicate
        with each other. These systems, physical as well as virtual, can be
        quite complex since they manage the controls for several processes and
        involve numerous sub-suppliers. Over time, complex systems tend to
        become even more advanced, which makes it difficult to isolate them from
        attacks and outside influences. The Sectra Network Alert service
        continuously performs network testing to search for loopholes in the
        security isolation layers. It was developed for critical infrastructure
        operations and is easily installed without any effect on the existing
        system.
