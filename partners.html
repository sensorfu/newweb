      <h2>Sectra</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity solutions and services for a new era. In order to offer
        the best possible product to the public, critical infrastructure
        operations have several types of systems and networks that communicate
        with each other. These systems, physical as well as virtual, can be
        quite complex since they manage the controls for several processes and
        involve numerous sub-suppliers. Over time, complex systems tend to
        become even more advanced, which makes it difficult to isolate them from
        attacks and outside influences. The Sectra Network Alert service
        continuously performs network testing to search for loopholes in the
        security isolation layers. It was developed for critical infrastructure
        operations and is easily installed without any effect on the existing
        system.

          Sysctl was started out of necessity. Sister company, cybersecurity

          sold the solutions. Secure file transfer solution Deaddrop was the
          first product with USB cleaner Impex as a close second. Impex
          developed into a variety of products. To continue building protection
          and detection for security-critical organizations and critical
